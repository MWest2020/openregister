# European Client Register

## Project Introduction

The European Client Register is a collaborative initiative between Open Register, Nextcloud, and government agencies from France and Germany. This project aims to transform European standards and definitions into a practical, interoperable register that can be used by governments throughout Europe to store and manage client data in a standardized way.

You can also skip the context and dive right into the [api](/api/clientRegister).

### European Collaboration

This project represents a cross-border effort to address common challenges in public administration:

- **Nextcloud** contributes expertise in secure, open-source data storage and collaboration
- **French government agencies** provide insights from their "État Plateforme" (State as a Platform) initiative
- **German government agencies** share experience from their "Digitale Verwaltung" (Digital Administration) program
- **Open Register** offers the technical framework for implementing standardized registers
- **Digital Decade** aligns with the European Commission's program to accelerate digital transformation toward a more human-centered, sustainable, inclusive and prosperous society by 2030

Together, we're working to create a reference implementation that demonstrates how European standards can be applied in practice to create interoperable, privacy-respecting client data management systems.

### Digital Decade Integration

The European Client Register is designed to support the goals of the [Digital Decade](https://vng.nl/rubrieken/onderwerpen/digital-decade), the European Commission's vision for Europe's digital transformation by 2030. This program includes:

1. **Comprehensive legislation** - A package of laws and regulations that impact how local governments structure their digital infrastructure and services
2. **Standardization** - Common standards to ensure interoperability across member states
3. **Digital infrastructure** - Shared digital infrastructure components that enable cross-border services
4. **Adaptability** - Creating flexible IT landscapes that can adapt to changing requirements

By implementing the European Client Register in accordance with Digital Decade principles, local governments can ensure their client data management systems are future-proof and aligned with European digital strategy.

### Common Ground Integration

This project aligns with the [Common Ground](https://commonground.nl/) principles developed in the Netherlands, which promote:

1. **Component-based architecture** - Building modular, reusable components
2. **Data at the source** - Storing data once and using it multiple times
3. **Standard APIs** - Using standardized interfaces for data exchange
4. **Open standards** - Adopting open standards for interoperability

The Client Register serves as a key building block in the Common Ground ecosystem, providing a standardized way to store and access client information across different government services and applications.

### Connectivity through Standardization

By implementing European standards in a practical register, this project contributes to the broader goal of "connectivity through standardization" - enabling different systems to work together seamlessly through shared standards and interfaces.

Key standardization efforts we're building upon include:

- **European Interoperability Framework (EIF)** - Providing guidelines for public administrations on how to improve interoperability
- **ISA² Programme** - Developing digital solutions that enable public administrations to provide interoperable services
- **Single Digital Gateway Regulation** - Establishing a single digital gateway to provide access to information and procedures across the EU
- **Once-Only Principle** - Ensuring citizens and businesses provide data only once to public administrations

## Purpose and Scope

This document presents research and implementation guidance for building client registers based on European standards. It aims to:

1. **Identify and analyze relevant standards** for client data management
2. **Compare different approaches** to implementing these standards
3. **Provide practical guidance** for implementing a standards-compliant client register
4. **Demonstrate interoperability** with existing systems and standards

The resulting client register design serves as a reference implementation that can be adapted by government agencies across Europe to meet their specific needs while maintaining interoperability with other systems.

## References and Standards

This research and implementation guide draws upon the following standards and references:

### Core Standards
- [vCard Format Specification (RFC 6350)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350) - Contact information format
- [iCalendar Format (RFC 5545)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545) - Calendar and task data format

- [UBL Party Schema](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html#S-PARTY) - Business party representation


### EIDAS Regulation and Core Vocabularies

The [eIDAS Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) establishes a legal framework for electronic identification and trust services across EU member states. While the regulation itself doesn't mandate specific data models, implementations that support cross-border identification should align with the EU Core Vocabularies.

The European Commission officially recommends the [Core Vocabularies](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/e-government-core-vocabularies) for public administrations and entities that interact with them. In many EU-funded projects and cross-border services, these vocabularies are effectively mandatory.

### Dutch standards and guidelines

The [Nederlandse API Strategie](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/api/API-Strategie/) (Dutch API Strategy) provides guidelines for REST APIs in the Dutch public sector. Our client register design aligns with these guidelines:

- Use of JSON as the primary format
- Consistent naming conventions
- Support for filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Proper error handling

## Regulatory and Standards Compliance

When implementing client registers in European contexts, it's important to understand that certain standards are not merely recommendations but regulatory requirements or officially endorsed standards that must be applied in specific scenarios.

### Validation Resources

To ensure compliance with these standards, the following validation resources are available:

- [EU Core Vocabularies Validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/any/upload) - Validates against Core Vocabularies using SHACL
- [UBL Validation Tool](https://validatie.stpe.nl/) - Dutch UBL validation service
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) - Validates Schema.org markup
- [DCAT-AP Validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/dcat-ap/upload) - Validates DCAT-AP compliance

By using these validation tools during implementation, you can ensure that your client register meets all applicable standards and regulatory requirements.

## API Specification

To complement our standards-based client register design, we've created a comprehensive OpenAPI Specification (OAS) document that defines the API endpoints, request/response formats, and data schemas for implementing the client register.

### OpenAPI Specification

The complete API specification is available as an OpenAPI 3.0 document:

[View API Documentation](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://openregisters.app/oas/clientRegisters.oas.json)

This specification includes detailed definitions for:

- Client entities (Person and Organization)
- Task management
- Message handling
- Note management
- Relationship modeling
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Overvieuw Relationships Between Entities

All these entities are interconnected in our client management system:

![Entity Relationships](clientRegisters_2.svg)

The diagram above shows how:

1. **Clients** are the central entity
2. **Tasks** are associated with clients (one client can have many tasks)
3. **Messages** are linked to clients (communication history)
4. **Notes** are attached to clients (observations and information)
5. Tasks can be related to other tasks (for dependencies or subtasks)

## European Semantic Interoperability Standards

In addition to the standards we've already discussed, the European Union has developed several semantic interoperability initiatives that provide relevant data models and vocabularies for our client management system.

### Core Vocabularies

The [EU Core Vocabularies](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/e-government-core-vocabularies) are simplified, reusable, and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of entities in a context-neutral way. Several of these are directly applicable to our client register:

## Client Object

For our client information, we'll use the European Core Vocabularies (Core Person and Core Business) as our primary foundation, while ensuring compatibility with other standards including vCard, Schema.org, Open Klant API, and commercial CRM systems.

### Historical Context

The vCard standard (RFC 6350) represents one of the first industry-wide attempts to standardize person and organization information. Developed in the 1990s and still widely used today, vCard remains the dominant format for exchanging contact information between devices and applications, particularly in mobile phones, email clients, and contact management systems.

While vCard provides an excellent foundation for basic contact exchange, the European Core Vocabularies offer a more comprehensive approach specifically designed for government and business contexts, with stronger support for official identifiers, multilingual information, and regulatory compliance.

### Standard Comparison

While using EU Core Vocabularies as our primary standard, we maintain compatibility with other major person/client/organization standards:

## Task Object

For tasks, we'll primarily use the [iCalendar standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545) (RFC 5545), specifically the VTODO component, as our foundational standard. This choice is driven by several key factors:

### Historical Context

The iCalendar standard represents the most widely adopted format for calendar and task data exchange. Developed in the late 1990s and refined over time, it remains the foundation for most calendar systems, including those in major email clients, mobile devices, and dedicated calendar applications.

While newer API-based approaches exist, iCalendar's VTODO component provides a comprehensive model for task management that balances simplicity with powerful features like recurrence, reminders, and multi-participant support.

### Standards Comparison
  
While using iCalendar as our primary standard, we maintain compatibility with other major task standards:

:::note Thread Identifier
A thread is a way to group related messages together in a conversation. In messaging systems, it acts like a conversation ID that links all messages in a back-and-forth exchange. For example, when someone replies to an email or chat message, all those messages share the same thread ID (usually the UUID of the first message in the conversation) to keep them connected.
:::

## Message Object

For messages associated with clients, we'll use email standards (RFC 5322) as our primary foundation, while incorporating elements from JMAP and Schema.org to create a comprehensive message model.

### Historical Context

Email standards represent one of the oldest and most widely implemented digital communication formats. The Internet Message Format (RFC 5322, previously RFC 822) has been the foundation of email communication since the early days of the internet. This format has proven remarkably resilient, continuing to serve as the backbone of electronic communication despite the emergence of numerous messaging platforms.

While email standards provide an excellent foundation for message structure, newer standards like JMAP (JSON Meta Application Protocol) offer more modern API approaches for message handling. By combining these standards with Schema.org's semantic web capabilities, we create a message model that works across traditional email, modern messaging platforms, and web applications.

### Our Hybrid Approach

Based on this analysis, our message register uses a hybrid approach that:

1. **Adopts RFC 5322 as the foundation**
   - Ensures compatibility with email systems
   - Leverages a mature, widely-implemented standard
   - Provides a comprehensive message structure

2. **Incorporates JMAP concepts**
   - Adds modern API capabilities
   - Improves threading and synchronization
   - Supports efficient client operations

3. **Includes Schema.org properties**
   - Enhances semantic relationships
   - Improves web discoverability
   - Supports knowledge graph integration

4. **Adds UBL elements for business context**
   - Supports formal business communications
   - Enables process integration
   - Provides structured metadata

This approach ensures that our message register works with existing email systems while providing the rich features needed for business communication management.

:::note Thread Identifier
A thread is a way to group related messages together in a conversation. In messaging systems, it acts like a conversation ID that links all messages in a back-and-forth exchange. For example, when someone replies to an email or chat message, all those messages share the same thread ID (usually the UUID of the first message in the conversation) to keep them connected.

## Note Object

For client notes, we'll create a schema based on Schema.org's [Comment](https://schema.org/Comment) type as our primary foundation, enhanced with properties from UBL's Note element and commercial note-taking platforms to ensure broad compatibility.

### Historical Context

Note-taking and comment systems have evolved significantly from simple text annotations to rich, collaborative content platforms. While early digital note systems were primarily text-based, modern note-taking applications support rich formatting, multimedia content, and collaborative features.

The Schema.org Comment type provides a web-standard approach to representing notes and comments, with strong support for semantic relationships between the note and its subject. By combining this with UBL's more formal Note element structure and features from commercial platforms, we create a note system that works across different contexts from formal business documentation to collaborative team environments.

| shared | Sharing status | `{"type": "team", "users": ["user-456"]}` | object | Nextcloud shareTypes |
| permissions | Access rights | ["read", "write", "share"] | array[string] | Nextcloud permissions |

:::note About Property
The 'about' property is based on Schema.org's [about](https://schema.org/about) property, which indicates the subject matter of the content. In our implementation, we use it to create a direct link between the note and the entity it refers to (like a client, task, or message). The value should be a UUID or URI that uniquely identifies the referenced object. This creates a semantic relationship that can be used for filtering, searching, and organizing notes by their subject matter.

For example, a note with about: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" indicates this note is about that specific client record.
:::

This schema ensures notes can be:
- Synchronized with Office 365 OneNote/SharePoint
- Integrated with Google Keep/Docs
- Shared via Nextcloud Notes
- Embedded in UBL business documents
- Indexed for semantic search

## Order Object

For orders associated with clients, we'll use the Universal Business Language (UBL) Order schema as our primary foundation, while incorporating elements from other standards to create a comprehensive order model suitable for government and business contexts.

### Historical Context

The concept of standardized order documents has evolved significantly from paper-based purchase orders to electronic data interchange (EDI) formats and modern XML/JSON-based standards. The Universal Business Language (UBL) Order schema represents one of the most comprehensive and widely adopted standards for electronic order documents in Europe.

Developed by OASIS and adopted as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 19845), UBL provides a rich set of elements for representing orders in both commercial and governmental contexts. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has further endorsed UBL as part of the European e-procurement standards.

## Product Object

For products and services offered to clients, we'll use the Universal Business Language (UBL) Item schema as our primary foundation, while incorporating elements from other standards to create a comprehensive product model suitable for government and business contexts.

### Historical Context

Product and service catalogs have evolved from paper catalogs to electronic formats, with various standards emerging to describe products and services in different contexts. The Universal Business Language (UBL) Item schema provides a comprehensive approach to representing products and services in formal business and government contexts.

In the government context, products often represent permits, licenses, documents, and other tangible items that citizens and businesses can request. Having a standardized way to represent these products ensures consistency across different government services and improves interoperability between systems.
