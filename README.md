# Open Registers

Open Registers provides a way to quicly build and deploy standardized registers based on [NLGov REST API Design Rules](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/API-Design-Rules/) and [Common Ground Principles](https://common-ground.nl/common-ground-principes/). It is based on based on the concepts of defining object types in [`schema.json`](https://json-schema.org/) and storing objects in configurable source.

## What is Open Registers?

Open Registers is a system for managing registers in Nextcloud. A register is a collection of one or more object types that are defined by a [`schema.json`](https://json-schema.org/). Registers sort objects and validate them against their object types.

Registers can store objects either directly in the Nextcloud database, or in an external database or object store.

Registers provide APIs for consumption.

Registers can also apply additional logic to objects, such as validation that is not applicable through the [`schema.json`](https://json-schema.org/) format.

## Key Features

- 📦 **Object Management**: Work with objects based on [`schema.json`](https://json-schema.org/).
- 🗂️ **Register System**: Manage collections of object types.
- 🛡️ **Validation**: Validate objects against their types.
- 💾 **Flexible Storage**: Store objects in Nextcloud, external databases, or object stores.
- 🔄 **APIs**: Provide APIs for consumption.
- 🧩 **Additional Logic**: Apply extra validation and logic beyond [`schema.json`](https://json-schema.org/).
- 🗑️ [Object Deletion](website/docs/object-deletion.md) | Soft deletion with retention and recovery | Data safety, compliance, lifecycle management

# Open Register

Open Register is a powerful object management system for Nextcloud that helps organizations store, track, and manage objects with their associated metadata, files, and relationships. Born from the Dutch Common Ground initiative, it addresses the need for quickly deploying standardized registers based on centralized definitions from standardization organizations.

## Background

Open Register emerged from the Dutch Common Ground movement, which aims to modernize municipal data management. The project specifically addresses the challenge many organizations face: implementing standardized registers quickly and cost-effectively while maintaining compliance with central definitions.

### Common Ground Principles
- Decentralized data storage
- Component-based architecture
- Standardized definitions
- API-first approach

Open Register makes these principles accessible to any organization by providing:
- Quick register deployment based on standard schemas
- Flexible storage options
- Built-in compliance features
- Cost-effective implementation
